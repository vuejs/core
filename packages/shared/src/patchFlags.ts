// Patch flags are optimization hints generated by the compiler.
// when a block with dynamicChildren is encountered during diff, the algorithm
// enters "optimized mode". In this mode, we know that the vdom is produced by
// a render function generated by the compiler, so the algorithm only needs to
// handle updates explicitly marked by these patch flags.

// Patch flags can be combined using the | bitwise operator and can be checked
// using the & operator, e.g.
//
//   const flag = TEXT | CLASS
//   if (flag & TEXT) { ... }
//
// Check the `patchElement` function in './createRenderer.ts' to see how the
// flags are handled during diff.
